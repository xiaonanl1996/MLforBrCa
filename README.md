The "Scripts" folder contains all scripts for data management and analyses. 

The `config.yml` file contains yaml entres for the values these scripts expect to find in the project config file. One can update or add the paths where appropriate. 

The `renv.lock` file saves the current versions of R packages used in the analyses.
